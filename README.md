Steps to follow üìú

1. Fork it üç¥

You can get your own fork/copy of <your repo> by using the Fork button.

Fork Button

2. Clone it üë•

You need to go to your Fork of the Repository and then clone (download) it to local machine using

$ git clone https://github.com/<your username>/<your repo name>.git

This makes a local copy of repository in your machine.

Once you have cloned the Object_Oriented_Programming repository in Github, move to that folder first using change directory command on linux and Mac.

# This will change directory to a folder Object_Oriented_Programming                                                                   
$ cd Object_Oriented_Programming
Move to this folder for all other commands.

Now, lets add a reference to the original Object_Oriented_Programming repository using

$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/theabhishek07/Object_Oriented_Programming.git

This adds a new remote named upstream.

See the changes using

 $ git remote -v
 origin https://github.com/Your_Username/Object_Oriented_Programming.git (fetch)                                                      
 origin https://github.com/Your_Username/Object_Oriented_Programming.git (push)                                                        
 upstream https://github.com/theabhishek07/Object_Oriented_Programming.git (fetch)                                                     
 upstream https://github.com/theabhishek07/Object_Oriented_Programming.git (push)
3. Sync with the Remote üîÑ

Always keep your local copy of repository updated with the original repository.

# Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches
	$ git fetch --all --prune
# Switch to master branch
	$ git checkout master
# Reset local master branch to match upstream repository's master branch
	$ git reset --hard upstream/master
# Push changes to your forked Object_Oriented_Programming repo
	$ git push origin master
4. Create a new branch ‚ÄºÔ∏è

Whenever you are going to make a contribution. Please create a new branch using the command below and keep your master branch clean (i.e. synced with remote branch).

# It will create a new branch <branchname> with name and switch to branch <branchname>
	$ git checkout -b <branchname>
To switch to desired branch

# To switch from one folder to other
	$ git checkout <branchname>
To add the changes to the branch. Use

# To add all files to branch
	$ git add .
Type in a message relevant for the code reveiwer using

# This message get associated with all files you have changed
	$ git commit -m "relevant message"
Now, Push your awesome work to your remote repository using

# To push your work to your remote repository
	$ git push -u origin <branchname>
Finally, go to your repository in browser and click on compare and pull requests. Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your precious effort.

#To check git Version:
	$ git ‚Äîversion
#To configure username and email	 associated with the git account.
	$ git config --global user.email <your email id>
	$ git config --global user.name <your username>
#Go to the folder/file.

 	$ git init 
	$ git status
#add some file 
	$ touch  <Filename>
	$ git add <filename>	
	$ git commit -m <Message>
#To Connect to remote Repository 
	$ git remote add origin <RepoURL>
#To push to origin branch :
	$ git push -u origin master 
 
#It will ask you for SSH Key
